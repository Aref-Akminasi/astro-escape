# Astro Escape

I made this project during my 'Visual Design & Front-End Development' minor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This was part of my Communication & Multi-media Design course.

In this project, I used the 'Phaser' library to create the game. The aim of the game is to keep meteors from hitting and to stop bombs from falling on Earth.
